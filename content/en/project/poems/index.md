In this section you can find various poems I wrote in particular moments of my life. 

The choice to publish them on this space was hard because the poems are quite personal, but I think they could help somebody else who may have lived my same sensations. Besides, it’s useful for me having some kind of feedback from the reader. 

These poems were of help in difficult moments I have lived, and a good way to improve my English. In fact it is not easy writing in a language that is not your mother language and rimes are very difficult to find. 

Unfortunately I don’t have the exact writing dates of the poems, but I begun my writing roughly from the summer of 2004.

Have a good reading!

**Loneliness - Summer 2004**

Loneliness, you don't realize of her  
and she's already there  
She has long arms to surrond you  
in a dull embrace  
turing a clear path into a foggy trace  

She can sweep away  
all my happy thoughts  
about friends, love, the wolrd iself is now  
grey

It's like living in a closed, locked case  
alone without any grace  
I loose my hold on reality  
I have to strain to fight  
against her brutality  
But my hands are bare  
and my force is no more  

Wait, I'm not alone  
there's the loneliness over me,  
we talk to each other  
She's sitting on her throne  
She is my beloved, my princess  
I live with the loneliness  

<br/><br/>
**Loneliness, sweet fantasy - Autumn 2004**

I could live happy moments with her  
Not much is required,  
loneliness, torpor, darkness  
I can imagine thousands of stories  
Oh, so sweet fantasy,  
spare me some company  
'Cos only when you are  
I'm happy  
Alone no more  

She's so beautiful,  
we're talking to each other,  
smiling and leading us,  
hand in hand into foreseen matters  
I'm fine with her  
but she isn't real  
I woke up in my bed  
'cos she was without the head  

<br/><br/>
**Breaking in - Spring 2005**

Like lighting in a cloudless sky  
Like a laugh after a sorrow cry  
I've heard you breaking in  

'Twas a fast moment, not long, not planned  
A sweet touch and voice and my heart,  
Clamped  
You were ruling the game  
with the impetuousness of impatient child,  
cheeky as if you knew me for years  

Like a sudden flash after ages of darkness  
Like a thread of hope after despair knitting  
I've felt you breaking in  

I fell,  
not because of weakness  
not because of your shamelessness  
I fell because of the whole you  

Time will pass,  
like the light through a glass,  
future unclear,  
like a fabric not stoo sheer  
A single thing I surely know  
I was living my life and suddenly  
without warning  
I've heard you breaking in

**A piece that doesn't fit - July 2005**

Three weeks ago I begun a puzzle  
That puzzle was your face  
I saw it growing every day  
Your smile coming up pace by pace  

And day by day, a simple carton shape  
a piece from the lot I placed  
How to figure out where it mate?  
Then the original hidden fear  
slowly came up, thin as a spear.  

A single hole in the puzzle remained  
A small piece in the bunch, explained:  
I realize the uselessness of the game  
as my hand was holding that small coloured strain  

After all, there was no point in trying to fit  
that strange piece,  
the last of the heap.  

<br/><br/>
**The Art of Waiting - February 2006**

I could feel you like my shadow,  
You were following my steps,  
Behind me, hiding like a shy child  

Explicit invitation can bring emotions,  
but for how long?  
Carrying on values can bring strenght,  
but for how long?  

Sufferings between us,  
two untidy lifes fighting for matching  

You demanded something I was not to give,  
You demanded something I was not to perceive.  
I will give my prudence to the hurried,  
My patience to the impulsive,  
My spirit to the sensual  

Ask for discernment,  
Ask for true Love,  
Ask for the Art of Waiting.
