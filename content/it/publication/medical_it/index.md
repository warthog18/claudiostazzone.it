abstract: "We are getting closer and closer: at the end of this year the new version of the standard concerning EMC tests and measurements on medical electrical equipment will become reality. Yes, the old one will be superseded. This change will influence (actually is already doing that) the whole approach to the EMC testing of these devices, on both sides! On one side, the EMC engineers. On the other, the manufacturers. In this article I will lay down all the differences between the previous and the last version of the standard, plus some electronic design hints for having a successful result on EMC testing against this new standard."
